# ProDev Frontend Engineering Program â€“ Personal Journey

This document outlines my journey through the ProDev Frontend Engineering program, where I built real-world frontend applications, collaborated with peers, and practiced using modern tools and best practices.

---

## Program Overview

The ProDev Frontend Engineering program is designed to help learners become industry-ready frontend developers by building hands-on projects using modern web technologies. It includes guided practice with tools like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, GraphQL, and more.

As part of the program, I collaborated with backend learners to build fullstack projects, connected to live APIs, and pushed my code to production-level repositories.

## Key Learnings from My Journey

### Technologies Covered
- **Web Development**
- **Mobile Development (with Expo and React Native)**
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**

### Tools and Concepts I Used
- **Next.js**: Used for building fast, SEO-friendly frontend apps
- **Tailwind CSS**: Helped style pages efficiently with utility classes
- **TypeScript**: Improved my code quality with static typing
- **GraphQL**: Queried data from APIs with more flexibility
- **API Integration**: Connected frontend to backend endpoints to fetch dynamic data
- **System Design and Analysis**: Applied structured thinking to break down features and UI components

## Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Understanding GraphQL syntax | Practiced with real APIs like Rick and Morty, and explored Apollo Client examples |
| Styling fast without writing much CSS | Adopted Tailwind CSS for rapid, reusable styling |
| Debugging API and component issues | Used Chrome DevTools and React Developer Tools to inspect requests and component state |

## Best Practices and Personal Takeaways

- **Plan before coding**: Designing components and layout first saved time during development
- **Write modular code**: I used components to keep code organized and reusable
- **Test early and often**: This helped catch bugs before they became big issues
- **Read official documentation**: Especially helpful for new tools like GraphQL and TypeScript
- **Collaborate actively**: Learned a lot by working with backend peers and discussing solutions

---

## Collaboration

### Who I Collaborated With
- **Frontend learners**: We exchanged ideas, reviewed each other's code, and improved together
- **Backend learners**: Worked with their endpoints to integrate dynamic data into the frontend

### Where We Collaborated
- **Discord Channel**: `#ProDevProjectNexus`
  - Used for team updates, Q&A, and syncing with backend teams
  - In the first week, I used the channel to find a backend learner working on the same project

## Summary

This program strengthened my frontend development skills and gave me real experience working with modern web tools and APIs. It also improved how I plan, write, and structure code in collaborative environments.
